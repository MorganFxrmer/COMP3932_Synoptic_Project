\section{Aim and Objectives}
The primary aim of this project is to develop a mobile-compatible application that integrates pose estimation with a fatigue prediction model. This software will provide real-time monitoring of weightlifting form and fatigue levels, providing actionable form correction suggestions to improve athlete performance and minimise injury risk by the end of the project timeline.

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Collect and annotate a dataset of key weightlifting movement sequences using MediaPipe pose data and fatigue indicators scaled to 0-10, within the first month of the project.
    \vspace{-10pt}
    \item Develop and train an LSTM model to predict fatigue levels with at least 80\% accuracy, using temporal pose data from the annotated dataset, by the second month of the project.
    \vspace{-10pt}
    \item Implement a mobile-compatible application that integrates MediaPipe pose estimation and the LSTM model for real-time fatigue prediction and form analysis, deployable on iOS and Android, by the third and final month of the project.
    \vspace{-10pt}
    \item Validate the performance of the application by achieving correct fatigue predictions in at least 80\% of the test cases, within the third and final month of the project.
\end{enumerate}

\item A custom dataset in the repository containing annotated weightlifting sequences with MediaPipe pose data and fatigue labels, linked to Objective 1, stored in a structured CSV format with documentation.
    \item A trained LSTM model for fatigue prediction, linked to Objective 2, provided as a saved model file with a performance report detailing accuracy metrics.
    \item A mobile-compatible application, linked to Objective 3, delivered as a software repository containing source code, build instructions and APK files for Android deployment.
    \item A comprehensive final project report, encompassing all objectives, detailing the background research, methodology, implementation and results of this project submitted as a PDF.
